# CSS-Usage-Analysis
A php script to check if files use css classes

I was anoyed when creating different scripts, with several pages, and created several css classes. Sometimes I removed usage of a class, to use something else, and I usally forgot.

So this script is to get a better view over used css classes and classes that are not being used.
